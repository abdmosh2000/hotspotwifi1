# This file contains error messages which are shown to user, when http/https
# login is used.
# These messages can be changed to make user interface more friendly, including
# translations to different languages.
#
# Various variables can be used here as well. Most frequently used ones are:
#	$(error-orig)	- original error message from hotspot
#	$(ip)		- ip address of a client
#	$(username)	- username of client trying to log in

# internal-error
# It should never happen. If it will, error page will be shown
# displaying this error message (error-orig will describe what has happened)

# If http-chap login method is used, but hotspot program does not receive

# If JavaScript is enabled and login.html page is valid,
